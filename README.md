# Daily Planner

## Description

A daily planner made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project was made to reinforce the knowledge of Javascript, aplying the DOM concepts, momentJS and dayJS libraries.

### What was done?

The HTML and CSS structure were downloaded and a few things were modified. All the JS code were built from scratch.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When you open the link, you'll be able to see and add the plans you have for today. The plan was made based in business hours, so you'll see slots from 9am to 6pm. The slots in the past will be shown in gray, the present one in red and the future ones in green.
